      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Efficient light transport simulation is important for many applications
        in computer graphics. Many-light methods based on virtual
        point lights (VPLs) especially work well for scenes consist mainly of
        diffuse materials. Rendered images with VPLs, however, are known
        to suffer from energy loss due to clamping of the VPL contributions.
        Removing this clamping unfortunately introduces significant
        variance in images due to the singularities of VPLs. We propose an
        efficient and practical algorithm which compensates energy loss
        of VPLs using yet another efficient rendering method â€“ photon
        splatting. Recent unified path sampling frameworks shows that
        VPLs are in fact photons. Based on this unified formulation, we
        propose to reuse VPLs as photons to compensate missing energy of
        clamped VPLs. This combination is very natural: the singularities of
        VPLs happen if a shading point is too close to VPLs, but such VPLs
        can also be seen as neighboring photons that are indeed useful for
        photon density estimation.We formulate this energy compensation
        process using multiple importance sampling to optimally combine
        rendering with VPLs and photon splatting. Our algorithm can be
        efficiently implemented on GPUs since rendering with VPLs and 
        photon splatting are both suitable for GPUs. The results demonstrate
        that our method produces more accurate images in the same
        rendering time than the existing methods. For common use cases
        of rendering mostly diffuse scenes, our work leads to an efficient,
        accurate, and practical rendering algorithm based on VPLs.
